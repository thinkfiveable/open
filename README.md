# Perfect
The best Next.js boilerplate ever.
# What does this have?
- Tailwind CSS (no more going through the installation guide!) - for styling components easily
- `next-themes` (@pacocoursey) - for going to the dark side
- `swr` (@vercel) - for fetching constantly mutating data
  - `fetcher.js` so you don't have to keep writing return functions
- `framer-motion` - for making interactive components and eye-catching animations
- `react-icons` - for including your favorite icon packs without increasing bundle size significantly. Tree shaking included.
